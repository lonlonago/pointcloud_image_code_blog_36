#  IV. Experimental experience 

   Since there is no data used in the paper experiment, I tested it with my own point cloud data, and the efficiency of the algorithm is not very high (it may be due to the large amount of data, so voxel filtering is added to the algorithm, which can be deleted if not needed, without affecting the overall framework of the algorithm), and the accuracy has not reached the height described in the text for the time being.
